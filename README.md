## General info
<p align="justify"> 
An application developed using the excellent TMDB API. The user logs into the application using one of three methods (FirebaseAuth) or automatically (Hive) if he has logged in before. On the main screen, there are various categories of movies and TV shows such as Popular, Coming Soon, Recommended (only visible to users who have liked any titles) Greatest Hits, Random Decade Hits (selected randomly when the app starts), Best of Random Year and Categories (genres). Users can search for given movies, TV shows or actors and see their favorites in dedicated screens.<br />
  After clicking on a given tile, a screen with details is shown. For a given actor it include photos, a list of films and TV shows in which actor appeared, a career description and basic data such as place of birth, age and height. For movies and TV shows the following are shown: cast, description, photos, similar titles, rating, genres and detailed data (for movies - release date, runtime, budget and revenue, for TV shows - years in which the title aired, total number of seasons and episodes). For TV shows, there is also a screen with detailed information about  seasons with a list of episodes and their data (title, broadcast date, description, length, rating).
